# ZenCncController
Install the optional Arduino Control package on a ZenToolworks CNC router supplied as a kit 
When the cnc is purchased as a kit, you have the option to purchase either the Mach3 controller which has a parallel port interface or the Arduino Grbl USB interface controller. This project is providing a way to centralize all the optional controller parts into a single housing and provide the wiring harness to connect the controller to the stepper motors and the limit switches.
