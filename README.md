# ZenCncController
Install the optional Arduino Control package on a Zen Toolworks CNC router supplied in kit form.

When the cnc is purchased as a kit, you have the option to purchase either the Mach3 controller which has a parallel port interface or the Arduino Grbl USB interface controller. This project is providing a way to centralize all the optional controller parts for the Arduino Controller option into a single housing and provide the wiring harness to connect the controller to the stepper motors and the limit switches.

The housing and associated pieces for the Arduino Control package have been designed in CAD and saved as STL files. I used these files to build the pieces using a 3d printer. The process of assembling these pieces and using this assembly to home the optional controller parts is listed in the Wiki page.
